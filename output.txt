Step 1: Preprocessor declaration <iostream>
Step 2: Declaration of std namespace to be used
Step 3: Function prototype declaration of return type int with name func
Step 5: Function declaration of main with return type int
Step 6: Initialize a,b; of data type int
Step 7: Assign  a+b; to c  of data type int
Step 8: Assign the value of  c+m; to d
Step 9: Check if the condition  a == b is satisfied and start block
Step 10: Assign the value of  Something; to Execute
Step 11: End block
Step 12: Initialise variable i=0 of data type int  Until condition i<10 is satisfied, at the end of the loop execute i++ and start block
Step 13: Assign the value of  Something; to Execute
Step 14: End block
Step 15: Output:   "Welcome to C++!"   then end line and go to the next one
Step 16: Return  0 to the user
Step 17: End block
