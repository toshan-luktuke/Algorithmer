Step 1: Preprocessor declaration <iostream>
Step 2: Declaration of std namespace to be used
Step 3: Function prototype declaration of return type int with name func
Step 4: Function declaration of main with return type int and start function block
Step 5: Function prototype declaration of return type int with name a,b;
Step 6: Assign the value of  Student(10, 15); to Student s
Step 7: Function prototype declaration of return type int with name c = a+b;
Step 8: Assign the value of  c+m; to d
Step 9: Check if the condition  a == b is satisfied and start block
Step 10: Assign the value of  Something; to Execute
Step 11: End block
Step 12: Function declaration of i=0;i<10;i++){ with return type for(int and start function block
Step 13: Assign the value of  Something; to Execute
Step 14: Break out of the loop 
Step 15: End block
Step 16: Output:   "Welcome to C++!"   then end line and go to the next one
Step 17: Return  0 to the user
